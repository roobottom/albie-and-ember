## Development

You can run `gulp` commands directly:

* `gulp` builds the site and start the devlopment server on port `8080`
* `gulp build` builds the site, but doesn't run a server

## Live

Running `npm start` will:

* Install all dependancies.
* Build out the site to the `_site` folder
* Start an expressjs server with gzip compression enabled on port `3030`
