# Albie gets lost

## Metanarrative

Albie is Ember’s favourite toy. One day, while out in the pram, Ember falls asleep. Albie slips from Ember’s grip and, unnoticed by mummy, Albie is lost on the street. 

Ember is distraught when she discovers that Albie is no where to be found. “Albie! ALBIE!!” She shouts, to no avail. 

The wind picks-up albie and, like a flying squirrel, Albie flies up and over the treetops. 

Over the sea.

Over the park.

Over the houses.

And in. In through the open window of Ember’s bedroom.

Can it be, my little Albie had flown back to me?

Close on Embers cot, she is fast asleep, cuddling Albie.

## Script

Albie is Ember’s favourite teddy. 
Everywhere Ember goes, Albie goes too.
Even when Ember goes out in the push-chair with Mummy, Albie has to come along.
But one day Ember fell asleep. And Albie, slipped out of her hand and onto the ground.
Mummy didn’t notice and Albie was lost.
Oh no! What can Albie do to get back home? Ember and Mummy were already so far away he couldn’t see them anymore.
Albie lay on the floor for a very long time. So long in fact that it started to get dark.
Albie was scared and he missed Ember very much.
But then, he noticed that the wind had begun to blow. A little at first so that his little arms and legs began to flap around.
But then stronger, and stronger until... Albie took off!
He flew over the tree-tops, and up up into the sky.
“Whee” thought Albie as he flew over the sea, over little fishing boats with twinkly light.
“Whee” thought Albie as he flew over the park, quiet now all the children were in bed.
“Home!” Thought Albie as he saw the little house where he lived with Ember.
He did a final loop-the-loop and flew in Ember’s bedroom window.
“Albie!” shouted Ember. “Albie, Albie!”. She shouted so loud that Mummy came up the stairs and into the bedroom to see what all the fuss was about.
But Ember was already fast asleep, cuddling Albie as tight as she could.

The End.
