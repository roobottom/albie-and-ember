# Albie gets lost

## Metanarrative

Albie is Ember’s favourite toy. One day, while out in the pram, Ember falls asleep. Albie falls from Ember’s grip and, unnoticed by mummy, Albie is lost on the street. 

Ember is distraught when she discovers that Albie is no where to be found. She’s unable to sleep without him that night. “Albie! ALBIE!!” She shouts, to no avail. 

Little does Ember know, but Albie has been picked up by a dog, out on a walk?

Groan, this is hard!


Anyway, Albie and Ember are reunited. All is well again. Close on Embers cot, she is fast asleep, cuddling Albie.
