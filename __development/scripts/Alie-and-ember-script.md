Albie is Ember’s favourite teddy. 
Everywhere Ember goes, Albie goes too.
Albie especially likes it when Mummy takes Ember for a walk in the pushchair.
But one day, while they were out, Ember fell asleep and she started to let go of Albie. He tried  to hold on, but he fell out and on to the floor.
Mummy didn’t notice and Albie was lost.
Oh no! What can Albie do to get back home? Ember and Mummy were already so far away he couldn’t see them anymore.
Albie lay on the floor for a very long time. So long in fact that it started to get dark.
Albie was scared and he missed Ember very much.
But then, he noticed that the wind had begun to blow. A little at first so that his little arms and legs began to flap around.
But then stronger, and stronger until... Albie took off!
He flew over the tree-tops, and up up into the sky.
“Whee” thought Albie as he flew over the sea, over little fishing boats with twinkly light.
“Whee” thought Albie as he flew over the park, quiet now all the children were in bed.
“Home!” Thought Albie as he saw the little house where he lived with Ember.
He did a final loop-the-loop and flew in Ember’s bedroom window.
“Albie!” shouted Ember. “Albie, Albie!”. She shouted so loud that Mummy came up the stairs and into the bedroom to see what all the fuss was about.
But Ember was already fast asleep, cuddling Albie as tight as she could.

The End.
