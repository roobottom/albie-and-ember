        <h1>Albie and Ember</h1>
        <p>Albie is Ember’s favourite teddy.</p>
        <p>Everywhere Ember goes, Albie goes too.</p>

      <article class="page page--2" data-page-id="2" id="page-2">
        <p>Albie especially likes it when Mummy takes Ember for a walk in the pushchair.</p>
        <p>But one day, while they were out, Ember fell asleep and she started to let go of Albie. He tried to hold on&#8230;</p>
        <p>but he couldn't and Albie fell onto the floor.</p>

        <p>Oh no! What can Albie do to get back home? Ember and Mummy were already so far away he couldn’t see them anymore.</p>
        <p>Albie lay on the floor for a very long time. So long in fact that it started to get dark.</p>
        <p>Albie was scared and he missed Ember very much.</p>

        <p>But then, what's this?</p>
        <p>The wind bagan to blow. A little at first. Albie's felt it rush over him. His little arms and legs began to move.</p>
        <p>It got stronger, and stronger until&#8230; Albie took off!</p>

        <p>He flew over the tree-tops, and up up into the sky.</p>
        <p>“Whee” thought Albie as he flew over the sea, over little fishing boats with twinkly light.</p>

      <article class="page page--6" data-page-id="6" id="page-6">
        <p>“Whee” thought Albie as he flew over the park, quiet now all the children were in bed.</p>

      <article class="page page--7" data-page-id="7" id="page-7">
        <p>“Home!” Thought Albie as he saw the little house where he lived with Ember.</p>

      <article class="page page--8" data-page-id="8" id="page-8">
        <p>He did a final loop-the-loop and flew in Ember’s bedroom window.</p>

      <article class="page page--9" data-page-id="9" id="page-9">
        <p>“Albie!” shouted Ember. “Albie, Albie!”. She shouted so loud that Mummy came up the stairs and into the bedroom to see what all the fuss was about.</p>

      <article class="page page--10" data-page-id="10" id="page-10">
        <p>But Ember was already fast asleep, cuddling Albie as tight as she could.</p>
        <p>The End.</p>
